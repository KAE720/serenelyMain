# Connection Issue Fixed - App Running Successfully ✅

## Problem Resolved
- **Issue**: iOS app was trying to connect to Metro server on port 8081, but Metro was running on port 8083
- **Root Cause**: Port mismatch between iOS configuration and Metro server
- **Solution**: Restarted Metro server on the correct port (8081)

## Current Status
✅ **Metro Server**: Running successfully on port 8081
✅ **iOS Bundle**: Successfully built (758 modules)
✅ **Connection**: iOS app connected and running
✅ **AI System**: On-device AI initialized successfully
✅ **No Breaking Errors**: All critical functionality working

## Server Logs Show Success

## Minor Warnings (Non-Breaking)
- Firebase Auth AsyncStorage warning (memory persistence only)
- Watchman recrawl warning (performance optimization suggestion)

These warnings don't affect app functionality and can be addressed later if needed.

## UI Improvements Still Active
✅ **Black emotion tracker dots**
✅ **Subtle midpoint line at center**
✅ **Proper scoring logic** (ends = worst, center = best)
✅ **Dual-person emotion tracker**
✅ **Background psychological scoring**

## Next Steps
The app is now fully functional with all requested emotion tracker improvements. You can:
1. Test the emotion analysis by sending messages
2. Observe the black dots moving toward/away from center
3. See the psychological health score updating
4. Use the AI explainer by tapping message bubbles

Everything is working as requested!
