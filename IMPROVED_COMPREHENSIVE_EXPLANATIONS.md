## üîÑ Pattern Matching Hierarchy

1. **Specific confrontation patterns** (highest priority)
   - "why did you..." with emotional context
   - "not happy with you" variations

2. **Direct emotional expressions**
   - "angry with you", "mad at you", "upset with you"
   - "frustrated with you", "disappointed in you"

3. **General emotional state + target**
   - "(angry|mad|upset) + (i am|im) + you"

4. **Questions with emotional context**
   - "why" + "you" + emotional words

5. **Generic emotional expressions**
   - Basic emotions without specific targets

6. **Fallback patterns**
   - Length-based, content-based defaults

## üéâ Result

The AI now correctly identifies and explains complex emotional expressions instead of falling back to generic responses. Your message will now get proper contextual explanations like:

- **"i am not happy and i am angry with you"** ‚Üí **"Expressing negative emotions toward them"** ‚úÖ
- **"i am frustrated with you right now"** ‚Üí **"Expressing frustration with them"** ‚úÖ
- **"why are you being like this?"** ‚Üí **"Demanding explanation from them"** ‚úÖ

Much more specific and helpful than the previous generic "Personal communication"!
