# Enhanced Analysis Text Removal

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Enhancement Badge
- **Removed**: "Enhanced Analysis" text from AI explanation popup
- **Removed**: Conditional rendering based on `item.isEnhanced`
- **Result**: Cleaner AI explanation popup with just emotion and explanation

### 2. Cleaned Up Styles
- **Removed**: `enhancementBadge` style definition
- **Result**: No unused styles in the codebase

## Before vs After

### Before
```javascript
{item.isEnhanced && (
    <Text style={styles.enhancementBadge}>
        Enhanced Analysis
    </Text>
)}
```

### After
```javascript
// Removed completely - just shows emotion and explanation
```

## AI Explanation Popup Now Shows
