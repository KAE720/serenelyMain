# EXAMPLE: Improved Message Explanations

## CURRENT PROBLEM
The explanations are too generic:
- "i love you" → "The sender is giving you a brief response or acknowledgment"  ❌
- "im stressed" → "The sender is sharing their thoughts or feelings" ❌

## WHAT WE WANT
Specific explanations of what the message actually means:
- "i love you" → "The person is expressing romantic love for you" ✅
- "im stressed" → "The person is sharing that they feel overwhelmed" ✅

## EXAMPLE CODE FOR COPILOT

```javascript
// IMPROVED generateMessageExplanationDemo() function
generateMessageExplanationDemo(text) {
    const lowerText = text.toLowerCase();

    // SPECIFIC MESSAGE MEANINGS (not emotions)
    if (lowerText.includes('i love you') || lowerText === 'love you') {
        return 'The person is expressing romantic love for you';
    }
    if (lowerText.includes('thank you') || lowerText.includes('thanks')) {
        return 'The person is showing gratitude for something you did';
    }
    if (lowerText.includes('how are you') || lowerText.includes('how\'s it going')) {
        return 'The person wants to know about your current wellbeing';
    }
    if (lowerText.includes('im stressed') || lowerText.includes('feeling stressed')) {
        return 'The person is sharing that they feel overwhelmed';
    }
    if (lowerText.includes('im angry') || lowerText.includes('mad at')) {
        return 'The person is expressing anger or frustration';
    }
    if (lowerText.includes('sorry')) {
        return 'The person is apologizing or expressing regret';
    }
    if (lowerText.includes('miss you')) {
        return 'The person is expressing that they want to be with you';
    }
    if (text.includes('?')) {
        return 'The person is asking you a question and wants a response';
    }

    // Default: analyze the actual content
    return `The person is communicating: ${text.toLowerCase()}`;
}
```

## COPILOT PROMPT FOR THIS:
"Update generateMessageExplanationDemo() in llmService.js to return specific explanations of what each message means, not generic emotional descriptions. Focus on the actual MESSAGE CONTENT like 'The person is expressing love' rather than 'The sender is sharing feelings'."
